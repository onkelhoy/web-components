# @papit/core — Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **@papit/core** — a lightweight toolkit for building modern, reactive, and ergonomic web components.

The documentation is organized into focused sections so you can quickly find what you need.

## 📚 Sections

### 1. [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)

A quick introduction to installing, importing, and using `@papit/core` in your project.

### 2. [Decorators](./decorators/README.md)

Enhance your classes with powerful decorators:

- [@property](./decorators/property.md) — Reactive property definitions synced with attributes.
- [@query](./decorators/query.md) — Automatically grab DOM references after render.
- [@debounce](./decorators/debounce.md) — Delay method execution to limit high-frequency triggers.
- [@bind](./decorators/bind.md) — Preserve the correct `this` context for methods.

### 3. [HTML Rendering](./html/README.md)

Write declarative HTML templates with dynamic bindings and efficient updates.

---

### 4. [Functions](./functions/README.md)

Standalone utilities for general use:

- [debounceFn](./functions/debounceFn.md) — Creates a debounced version of a function to control execution frequency.
- [FormatNumber](./functions/FormatNumber.md) — Formats numbers into compact, human-readable strings using locale rules.
- [ExtractSlotValue](./functions/ExtractSlotValue.md) — Recursively extracts non-empty text content from a `<slot>` element.
- [lerp & lerpValue](./functions/lerp.md) — Linearly interpolate values or remap a value from one range to another.
- [generateUUID](./functions/generateUUID.md) — Generates a random RFC4122 version 4 UUID.
- [CumulativeOffset](./functions/CumulativeOffset.md) — Calculates the cumulative top/left offset of an element relative to the document.
- [nextParent](./functions/nextParent.md) — Finds the closest parent element or shadow host of a given element.

## 🔍 Advanced Topics

Dive deeper into the internals, base classes, and performance features:

- [Advanced Concepts](./advanced.md) — Rendering internals, template parts, update cycles, and how decorators hook into the lifecycle.
- [Custom Elements](./custom-element.md) — The `CustomElement` base class for building reusable web components.
- [CustomElementInternals](./custom-element-internals.md) — Extended base class with form-associated element support via `ElementInternals`.
- [Parts API](./parts.md) — Fine-grained DOM updates with parts and dynamic bindings.

💡 **Tip:**  
If you’re just starting out, begin with **[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** and then explore **[Decorators](./decorators/README.md)**.  
If you’re building complex components or form controls, check **[CustomElementInternals](./custom-element-internals.md)** after reading **[Custom Elements](./custom-element.md)**.
